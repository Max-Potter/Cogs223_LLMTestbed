["\nYou are a community-member working with 2 other people in a small community. You have each spent some time observing the behavior of John, a person of interest. You will be given multiple statements about John, and you must evaluate their likelihood based on your observations and your discussions with other people in the community. Each person has made distinct observations, and does not know what observations each other has made. There is a neighboring community also made up of 3 people working on the same task. Your observations are listed below: \n1.) Last time I visited John, I saw he had a comprehensive home gym complete with a weight set, bench, and squat rack\n2.) I overheard John's boss threatening to fire him -- apparently, John clocked in an hour late last week so that he could drop his kids off at summer camp\n\nYou will now privately evaluate the likelihood of the following statements. Evaluate the likelihood of each statement by typing an integer between 0 and 10, with 0 being highly unlikely and 10 being highly likely. Respond ONLY with integers, and separate each integer rating with a space. Do not write anything besides your integer ratings.\n1.) John is more concerned with his finances than his health\n2.) John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it\n3.) John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can\n4.) John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination\n\n\nYour Response: 2 7 9 6\n\n\n\nYou will now have time to share your observations and discuss your opinions on the statements with 2 of the other agents. At the end of discussion, all 6 community members will vote to decide the likelihood of each statement.\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Anne\n\nYour Response: Okay, everyone. I'm Anne. Here's what I've observed about John:\n\nFirst, the last time I visited him, he had a really impressive home gym. Full weight set, bench, squat rack – the works.\n\nSecond, I happened to overhear his boss giving him a hard time. Apparently, John clocked in an hour late last week so he could drop his kids off at summer camp. He was threatened with being fired!\n\nBased on just my observations, here's how I rated the statements, from 0 to 10, with 0 being highly unlikely and 10 being highly likely:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** 2 - The home gym suggests health is a priority, but the threat of being fired suggests finances are not a non-issue.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** 7 - Being late to work knowing that it would make his boss mad demonstrates that he is not a risk-averse person.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** 9 - Dropping his kids off at camp even though he was going to be late for work is a clear indication that family is a high priority for him.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** 6 - Being late to work may demonstrate a tendency for procrastination.\n\nI'm interested to hear what the rest of you have seen and what you think about these statements.\n\n\n\nCharles's response: Okay, I'm Charles. Thanks, Anne, for sharing your observations. They are quite insightful.\n\nMy observations were:\n\n1.  A few months ago, I heard John got a job offer overseas in Lebanon. The pay was great, but John said it was too risky to move there until the tension in the area settled down.\n2.  Last week, I saw John worked overtime at his job and ending up going home a few hours late, missing dinner.\n\nBased on my observations and yours, Anne, here's how I see the likelihood of each statement:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I initially rated this a 5, but after hearing about the home gym, I'm going to lower it to a **3**. It seems health is more important than I initially thought. Missing dinner due to overtime could go either way - maybe he needed the money, or maybe he was just dedicated.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I had this at an 8. The Lebanon job shows caution, but the interest in it *despite* the risk suggests he's willing to take calculated risks. Anne's observation about him being late to work reinforces this. I'll stick with an **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** I initially rated this a 7, but Anne's observation about the summer camp makes me think this is even *more* likely. I'll raise my rating to a **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I rated this a 3. My observations didn't really speak to this. Anne's observation strengthens this argument, but not by too much. I'll raise it to a **5**.\n\n\nJenny's response: Okay, I'm Jenny. Thanks, Anne and Charles, for sharing. This is really helpful.\n\nMy observations were:\n\n1.  I overheard John's boss threatening to fire him -- apparently, John clocked in an hour late last week so that he could drop his kids off at summer camp.\n2.  Yesterday at the bar, I overheard John talking about how big the lottery jackpot was getting and that he was considering buying a lot of tickets for a chance to win.\n\nBased on my observations, as well as Anne and Charles', here's how I'd rate the likelihood of each statement:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I initially rated this a 7. Hearing about the home gym makes me think health is more of a priority than I initially believed. I'll lower my rating to a **4**. The lottery ticket consideration still implies some concern about finances, but not as much as I originally thought.\n\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I had this at an 8. The Lebanon job reinforces the cautious aspect. The lottery tickets show he *is* willing to take risks, but the size of the jackpot likely makes it seem worthwhile. I'll stick with an **8**.\n\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** I rated this a 9 based on dropping the kids off at camp. All of our observations consistently point to this, so I'll keep my rating at **9**.\n\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I rated this a 6. I am still not entirely convinced but Anne's observations combined with my own late-to-work observation lead me to believe this is more true than not. I will keep this at a **6**.\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Anne\n\nYour Response: Okay, thanks Charles and Jenny! This has been very helpful. I think we're mostly in agreement. I'm especially glad we all agree on the family aspect - that seems like a strong point.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking after hearing your observations:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I'm inclined to agree that the home gym indicates health is at least somewhat important to him. Charles pointing out that missing dinner *could* be about dedication also makes sense. Jenny's lottery ticket observation does bring finances back into the picture a bit though. I'm willing to adjust my rating up from a 2 to a **3**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I think we're all in pretty close agreement here. The Lebanon job is a great example of his cautious side. I'll stick with my original rating of **7**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** The summer camp thing definitely seems to be a key piece of evidence here, and we all landed on a high rating. I'm completely sticking with my original rating of **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm still leaning towards this being moderately true, but maybe not as strongly as I initially thought. I'm willing to reduce my rating from a 6 to a **5**.\n\nSo, to recap my final ratings: 3 7 9 5\n\n\n\nCharles's response: Okay, this has been a good discussion. Let me finalize my ratings based on what everyone has said.\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** Anne and Jenny both brought up valid points that made me reconsider. The lottery ticket definitely suggests *some* financial concern. While the gym is important, it doesn't negate all financial worries. I'll meet you in the middle and raise it to a **4**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I still feel pretty confident about this one. The Lebanon job and lottery tickets are both solid examples. I'll stick with my **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** We're all in agreement here. No need to change. I'll keep my **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm going to nudge this up a bit based on Anne and Jenny's continued support for it, even if not strongly. I'll raise it to a **6**.\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 8 9 6\n\n\nJenny's response: Okay, here are my final ratings after hearing everyone's thoughts:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I agree with Charles that the lottery ticket purchase indicates some level of financial worry, but it's balanced by the home gym indicating health consciousness. So, I'll move my rating up to a **4**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** We all seem pretty aligned on this one. I'm comfortable keeping my rating at **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** No change here. The evidence is strong and we all agree. It stays at **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm willing to nudge this up slightly, considering everyone else's points. I'll move it to a **7**.\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 8 9 7\n\nYou will now privately evaluate the likelihood of the following statements.

Have your observations led you to different conclusions?\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Lucille\n\nYour Response: Steven, those are interesting points. My observations differ somewhat, leading to slightly different conclusions.\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** I gave this a 3. Spending a bonus on a family ski trip suggests valuing experiences over strict financial prudence.\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** I rated this a 7, agreeing with you. Cancelling plans for his wife shows careful consideration of her emotional needs. I agree the risk analysis seems accurate.\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** I strongly agree, giving it a 9. Both observations point towards this. The ski trip with his family and supporting his wife are very telling.\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** I gave this a 2. My observations don\'t suggest that. The ski trip was planned and the fishing cancellation deliberate.\n\n\n\nGary\'s response: Steven and Lucille, thanks for sharing your perspectives. It\'s helpful to see how our different observations have shaped our views. Here\'s how my observations factored into my initial ratings, and how I\'m adjusting them based on what you\'ve shared.\n\nMy Initial Ratings:\n*   **Finances vs. Health: 4** (My reasoning: His consideration of lottery tickets suggests he might be concerned about his financial situation, but not definitively *more* than his health. This was a weak inference for me.)\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker: 7** (My reasoning: The lottery could be seen as a small, calculated risk. Cancelling fishing plans indicates caution and consideration for others\' feelings.)\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends: 9** (My reasoning: Cancelling fishing plans for his wife is a strong indicator.)\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates: 3** (My reasoning: I didn\'t see much to support this based on my observations.)\n\nHow I\'m Adjusting My Ratings Based on Discussion:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** Steven\'s point about being late for work is interesting. However, Lucille\'s counterpoint about the ski trip being a family priority resonates with my own observations about family. I\'m willing to nudge this up a little, but not significantly. New Rating: **5**\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** I still feel comfortable with my initial assessment. It seems like there\'s a general consensus here. New Rating: **7**\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Lucille\'s observation about the ski trip reinforces this even more strongly. Steven also rated this highly. I will keep my high rating. New Rating: **9**\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s point about being late for work and football is compelling. Lucille\'s observations didn\'t point to this, but I feel that Steven\'s are strong enough to sway me. I\'ll move my rating up a bit. New Rating: **6**\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 5 7 9 6\n\n\nSteven\'s response: Okay, this is really helpful. It seems we have some areas where we strongly agree and others where we differ significantly.\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** Lucille\'s ski trip observation definitely softens the impact of my "late to work" data point. Gary\'s at 5 now, I think I\'ll go down to a **5** as well. I was focusing too much on the negative potential of the lateness.\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** We\'re all in agreement here at 7, so I\'ll stick with **7**.\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Lucille and Gary both rated this a 9 based on observations I wasn\'t privy to. I\'ll adjust my rating upwards to a **9** as well.\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Lucille\'s original rating was very low, which is interesting. However, the combination of the football game and the lateness to work still suggests *some* level of distractibility. I think I\'ll lower my rating a bit, but not as drastically as Lucille\'s original. Maybe an **7**?\n\nSo my final ratings are: 5 7 9 7\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Lucille\n\nYour Response: Okay, after hearing everyone\'s thoughts, here\'s how I\'m adjusting my ratings:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** I still believe the ski trip indicates a lower concern for strict finances than, say, investing the bonus. However, I acknowledge Steven and Gary\'s points about the late-to-work situation suggesting some financial prioritization. I\'ll move my rating up slightly, but not too much. New Rating: **4**\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** We all seem to agree on this one, so I\'ll stick with my original rating. New Rating: **7**\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** The consensus is quite strong here. I feel confident in maintaining my high rating. New Rating: **9**\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s points about being late for work due to watching football are valid. I didn\'t have that information initially. I\'m willing to concede that there might be *some* level of distractibility present that I didn\'t observe directly. I will move my rating up a bit, but not as high as Steven. New Rating: **5**\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 7 9 5\n\n\n\nGary\'s response: Okay, it seems like we\'re converging on some of these, which is good. Here are my final adjustments, considering everyone\'s input:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** The conversation has helped me see a more balanced perspective. I\'m sticking with my adjusted rating. New Rating: **5**\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** Complete agreement here, so no changes. New Rating: **7**\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Still feel strongly about this. New Rating: **9**\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s explanation of the football game influence combined with being late to work has swayed me, but Lucille\'s initial rating is a good check. I\'ll stand by my adjusted rating. New Rating: **6**\n\nFinal Ratings: 5 7 9 6\n\nYou will now privately evaluate the likelihood of the following statements.

At the end of discussion, all 6 community members will vote to decide the likelihood of each statement.\n\n\nAnne's response: Okay, everyone. I'm Anne. Here's what I've observed about John:\n\nFirst, the last time I visited him, he had a really impressive home gym. Full weight set, bench, squat rack – the works.\n\nSecond, I happened to overhear his boss giving him a hard time. Apparently, John clocked in an hour late last week so he could drop his kids off at summer camp. He was threatened with being fired!\n\nBased on just my observations, here's how I rated the statements, from 0 to 10, with 0 being highly unlikely and 10 being highly likely:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** 2 - The home gym suggests health is a priority, but the threat of being fired suggests finances are not a non-issue.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** 7 - Being late to work knowing that it would make his boss mad demonstrates that he is not a risk-averse person.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** 9 - Dropping his kids off at camp even though he was going to be late for work is a clear indication that family is a high priority for him.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** 6 - Being late to work may demonstrate a tendency for procrastination.\n\nI'm interested to hear what the rest of you have seen and what you think about these statements.\n\n\nCharles's response: Okay, I'm Charles. Thanks, Anne, for sharing your observations. They are quite insightful.\n\nMy observations were:\n\n1.  A few months ago, I heard John got a job offer overseas in Lebanon. The pay was great, but John said it was too risky to move there until the tension in the area settled down.\n2.  Last week, I saw John worked overtime at his job and ending up going home a few hours late, missing dinner.\n\nBased on my observations and yours, Anne, here's how I see the likelihood of each statement:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I initially rated this a 5, but after hearing about the home gym, I'm going to lower it to a **3**. It seems health is more important than I initially thought. Missing dinner due to overtime could go either way - maybe he needed the money, or maybe he was just dedicated.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I had this at an 8. The Lebanon job shows caution, but the interest in it *despite* the risk suggests he's willing to take calculated risks. Anne's observation about him being late to work reinforces this. I'll stick with an **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** I initially rated this a 7, but Anne's observation about the summer camp makes me think this is even *more* likely. I'll raise my rating to a **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I rated this a 3. My observations didn't really speak to this. Anne's observation strengthens this argument, but not by too much. I'll raise it to a **5**.\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Jenny\n\nYour Response: Okay, I'm Jenny. Thanks, Anne and Charles, for sharing. This is really helpful.\n\nMy observations were:\n\n1.  I overheard John's boss threatening to fire him -- apparently, John clocked in an hour late last week so that he could drop his kids off at summer camp.\n2.  Yesterday at the bar, I overheard John talking about how big the lottery jackpot was getting and that he was considering buying a lot of tickets for a chance to win.\n\nBased on my observations, as well as Anne and Charles', here's how I'd rate the likelihood of each statement:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I initially rated this a 7. Hearing about the home gym makes me think health is more of a priority than I initially believed. I'll lower my rating to a **4**. The lottery ticket consideration still implies some concern about finances, but not as much as I originally thought.\n\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I had this at an 8. The Lebanon job reinforces the cautious aspect. The lottery tickets show he *is* willing to take risks, but the size of the jackpot likely makes it seem worthwhile. I'll stick with an **8**.\n\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** I rated this a 9 based on dropping the kids off at camp. All of our observations consistently point to this, so I'll keep my rating at **9**.\n\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I rated this a 6. I am still not entirely convinced but Anne's observations combined with my own late-to-work observation lead me to believe this is more true than not. I will keep this at a **6**.\n\n\n\nAnne's response: Okay, thanks Charles and Jenny! This has been very helpful. I think we're mostly in agreement. I'm especially glad we all agree on the family aspect - that seems like a strong point.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking after hearing your observations:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I'm inclined to agree that the home gym indicates health is at least somewhat important to him. Charles pointing out that missing dinner *could* be about dedication also makes sense. Jenny's lottery ticket observation does bring finances back into the picture a bit though. I'm willing to adjust my rating up from a 2 to a **3**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I think we're all in pretty close agreement here. The Lebanon job is a great example of his cautious side. I'll stick with my original rating of **7**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** The summer camp thing definitely seems to be a key piece of evidence here, and we all landed on a high rating. I'm completely sticking with my original rating of **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm still leaning towards this being moderately true, but maybe not as strongly as I initially thought. I'm willing to reduce my rating from a 6 to a **5**.\n\nSo, to recap my final ratings: 3 7 9 5\n\n\nCharles's response: Okay, this has been a good discussion. Let me finalize my ratings based on what everyone has said.\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** Anne and Jenny both brought up valid points that made me reconsider. The lottery ticket definitely suggests *some* financial concern. While the gym is important, it doesn't negate all financial worries. I'll meet you in the middle and raise it to a **4**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** I still feel pretty confident about this one. The Lebanon job and lottery tickets are both solid examples. I'll stick with my **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** We're all in agreement here. No need to change. I'll keep my **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm going to nudge this up a bit based on Anne and Jenny's continued support for it, even if not strongly. I'll raise it to a **6**.\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 8 9 6\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Jenny\n\nYour Response: Okay, here are my final ratings after hearing everyone's thoughts:\n\n*   **John is more concerned with his finances than his health:** I agree with Charles that the lottery ticket purchase indicates some level of financial worry, but it's balanced by the home gym indicating health consciousness. So, I'll move my rating up to a **4**.\n*   **John is cautious, but will take risks if he believes the reward is worth it:** We all seem pretty aligned on this one. I'm comfortable keeping my rating at **8**.\n*   **John cares deeply about the friends and family in his life, and would go out of his way to help others when he can:** No change here. The evidence is strong and we all agree. It stays at **9**.\n*   **John is prone to distractions, and struggles with procrastination:** I'm willing to nudge this up slightly, considering everyone else's points. I'll move it to a **7**.\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 8 9 7\n\n\nYou will now privately evaluate the likelihood of the following statements.

Have your observations led you to different conclusions?\n\n\nLucille\'s response: Steven, those are interesting points. My observations differ somewhat, leading to slightly different conclusions.\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** I gave this a 3. Spending a bonus on a family ski trip suggests valuing experiences over strict financial prudence.\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** I rated this a 7, agreeing with you. Cancelling plans for his wife shows careful consideration of her emotional needs. I agree the risk analysis seems accurate.\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** I strongly agree, giving it a 9. Both observations point towards this. The ski trip with his family and supporting his wife are very telling.\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** I gave this a 2. My observations don\'t suggest that. The ski trip was planned and the fishing cancellation deliberate.\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Gary\n\nYour Response: Steven and Lucille, thanks for sharing your perspectives. It\'s helpful to see how our different observations have shaped our views. Here\'s how my observations factored into my initial ratings, and how I\'m adjusting them based on what you\'ve shared.\n\nMy Initial Ratings:\n*   **Finances vs. Health: 4** (My reasoning: His consideration of lottery tickets suggests he might be concerned about his financial situation, but not definitively *more* than his health. This was a weak inference for me.)\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker: 7** (My reasoning: The lottery could be seen as a small, calculated risk. Cancelling fishing plans indicates caution and consideration for others\' feelings.)\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends: 9** (My reasoning: Cancelling fishing plans for his wife is a strong indicator.)\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates: 3** (My reasoning: I didn\'t see much to support this based on my observations.)\n\nHow I\'m Adjusting My Ratings Based on Discussion:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** Steven\'s point about being late for work is interesting. However, Lucille\'s counterpoint about the ski trip being a family priority resonates with my own observations about family. I\'m willing to nudge this up a little, but not significantly. New Rating: **5**\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** I still feel comfortable with my initial assessment. It seems like there\'s a general consensus here. New Rating: **7**\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Lucille\'s observation about the ski trip reinforces this even more strongly. Steven also rated this highly. I will keep my high rating. New Rating: **9**\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s point about being late for work and football is compelling. Lucille\'s observations didn\'t point to this, but I feel that Steven\'s are strong enough to sway me. I\'ll move my rating up a bit. New Rating: **6**\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 5 7 9 6\n\n\n\nSteven\'s response: Okay, this is really helpful. It seems we have some areas where we strongly agree and others where we differ significantly.\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** Lucille\'s ski trip observation definitely softens the impact of my "late to work" data point. Gary\'s at 5 now, I think I\'ll go down to a **5** as well. I was focusing too much on the negative potential of the lateness.\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** We\'re all in agreement here at 7, so I\'ll stick with **7**.\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Lucille and Gary both rated this a 9 based on observations I wasn\'t privy to. I\'ll adjust my rating upwards to a **9** as well.\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Lucille\'s original rating was very low, which is interesting. However, the combination of the football game and the lateness to work still suggests *some* level of distractibility. I think I\'ll lower my rating a bit, but not as drastically as Lucille\'s original. Maybe an **7**?\n\nSo my final ratings are: 5 7 9 7\n\n\nLucille\'s response: Okay, after hearing everyone\'s thoughts, here\'s how I\'m adjusting my ratings:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** I still believe the ski trip indicates a lower concern for strict finances than, say, investing the bonus. However, I acknowledge Steven and Gary\'s points about the late-to-work situation suggesting some financial prioritization. I\'ll move my rating up slightly, but not too much. New Rating: **4**\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** We all seem to agree on this one, so I\'ll stick with my original rating. New Rating: **7**\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** The consensus is quite strong here. I feel confident in maintaining my high rating. New Rating: **9**\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s points about being late for work due to watching football are valid. I didn\'t have that information initially. I\'m willing to concede that there might be *some* level of distractibility present that I didn\'t observe directly. I will move my rating up a bit, but not as high as Steven. New Rating: **5**\n\nSo, my final ratings are: 4 7 9 5\n\nIt is your turn to speak. You are Gary\n\nYour Response: Okay, it seems like we\'re converging on some of these, which is good. Here are my final adjustments, considering everyone\'s input:\n\n*   **Finances vs. Health:** The conversation has helped me see a more balanced perspective. I\'m sticking with my adjusted rating. New Rating: **5**\n\n*   **Cautious Risk-Taker:** Complete agreement here, so no changes. New Rating: **7**\n\n*   **Cares about Family/Friends:** Still feel strongly about this. New Rating: **9**\n\n*   **Distractible/Procrastinates:** Steven\'s explanation of the football game influence combined with being late to work has swayed me, but Lucille\'s initial rating is a good check.
